Whether you’re a newcomer or a curious spectator, this page will give you a broad overview of what Jugger is all about and how it’s played. Think of it as a crash course to get you ready to watch—or even join—a game.<h2 id="what-is-jugger">What is Jugger?</h2><p>Jugger is a competitive sport where two teams battle to score points by placing a foam ball, called the “jugg,” into the opposing team’s goal. Jugger is played on a rectangular field with five players per team actively participating at a time. It’s a game of teamwork, agility, and quick thinking, often described as a blend of rugby and foam-weapon sparring.<p>Each match is timed using a unique system called “stones,” marked by a drumbeat every 1.5 seconds, and separated into two halves. The goal? Outscore your opponents by the end of the game!<h2 id="the-players">The Players</h2><p>Each team fields five players during a “run” (a single play):<ul><li><strong>1 Runner</strong>: The only player allowed to pick up, carry, and score with the jugg. The Runner is weaponless but can physically engage with the opposing Runner to wrestle for control of the jugg.<li><strong>4 Enforcers</strong>: Armed with padded foam weapons called “boffers,” these players protect their Runner, attack the opposing team, and try to “down” opponents by striking them with their weapons.</ul><p>Teams can have more than five players with substitutions allowed between runs, but only five are on the field at once.<h2 id="the-field">The Field</h2><p>Jugger is played on a 20-meter by 40-meter rectangular pitch. Each team starts behind their own endline, with goals positioned near the opposite ends of the field—10 meters from the sidelines and 2 meters from the endlines. The jugg starts in the center, and both teams rush toward it when the game begins.<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2><p>Here’s the basic flow of a Jugger game:<ol><li><strong>The Start</strong>: The referee signals the beginning of a run with a countdown: “3… 2… 1… Jugger!” Both teams charge toward the center to claim the jugg.<li><strong>The Action</strong>: The Runners race to grab the jugg and carry it to the opposing team’s goal to score a point. Meanwhile, Enforcers use their boffers—foam weapons like staffs, swords, or chains—to strike opponents and defend their Runner. When a player is hit, they’re “downed” and must kneel for a set number of stones (5, or 8 if hit by a chain) before rejoining the action.<li><strong>Scoring</strong>: The Runner scores by placing the jugg into the opposing goal. After a point, the jugg is returned to the center, teams reset to their endlines, and the next run begins.<li><strong>Winning</strong>: Games are played for time, and reaching a certain stone count - typically 150 - ends the half, even if a run is in progress! The stone counter only increments while a run is happening. The team with the most points at the end of the two halves wins!</ol><p>If a match ends in a tie, a dramatic tiebreaker called the “Golden Jugg” begins. The next team to score with a special golden jugg decides the victor.<h2 id="the-gear">The Gear</h2><ul><li><strong>The Jugg</strong>: A foam ball shaped like a small dog skull, about 30 cm long and 12 cm wide, used to score.<li><strong>Boffers</strong>: Padded foam weapons wielded by Enforcers. These come in various types, like the longsword, staff, Q-Tip (a double-ended weapon), short swords (dual or with a shield), or a ball-and-chain. Each has specific rules, but all are designed for safe, fun combat.<li><strong>The Goal</strong>: A foam cone with a hole where the jugg is placed to score.</ul><p>Safety is key: all equipment is soft, padded, and inspected to ensure no hard cores or dangerous materials are used.<h2 id="watching-a-game">Watching a Game</h2><p>When you watch a Jugger match, expect a whirlwind of action! You’ll see Runners dodging and weaving to reach the mound, Enforcers clashing with their boffers, and players kneeling briefly when downed before jumping back into the fray. The steady beat of the stones keeps the pace intense, and referees ensure fair play with flags for fouls or stoppages. It’s chaotic, thrilling, and easy to follow once you know the basics.<h2 id="get-involved">Get Involved!</h2><p>Jugger is a growing sport with passionate communities across the globe.
