The Arizona Jugger League was founded by experienced Jugger players who have enjoyed the sport since they began college. The AJL has a vision that we believe most Jugger players share - to see Jugger grow and become a mainstream sport.

Our mission is to support the community of competitive Jugger, and provide the resources to grow the sport. Through offering cash prize pools at our tournaments, we want to not only encourage new teams to form, but also raise the bar for experienced players to improve and push the limits of play.
