<cite>Unknown</cite>

The Arizona Jugger League is pleased to announce our premier tournament, Dust Bowl Masters 2026! As an organization focused on hosting high-quality, competitive Jugger tournaments, DBM 2026 will differ from past American Jugger tournaments in the following ways:

- There will be a **$2000 prize pool**, making DBM 2026 the first American tournament to ever offer a cash prize!
- All fields will have four paid referees, and attending teams will not be refereeing games. Enjoy your downtime between matches!
- All matches will be recorded with multiple camera angles, automatically compiled, and uploaded once the match concludes.

Along with the above, please see our FAQs section for more information on the tournament and how to register.
